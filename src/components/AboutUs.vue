                Our goal is to promote the knowledge and practice of AI in
                both the ITM and the local
                community, encouraging more students to join and promote research and technological
                developments.

              <p style="text-align: justify">
                We propose to achieve this through a solid core of
                researchers from both ITM
                and leading research centers such as CIMAT and CentroGeo, who will bring IA knowledge
                to students, in the form of conferences, symposiums, meetings, etc., but mainly, through
                workshops and courses, whose contents will be replicated to future generations of
                students.

                We are a community dedicated to increase knowledge and promote greater awareness of
                Artificial Intelligence, located (mainly) in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. The headquarters
                of the chapter are located at the Merida Institute of Technology (Instituto Tecnológico
                de Mérida)
